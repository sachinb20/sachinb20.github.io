Hi there! I am Sachin, a fourth year Undergraduate double majoring in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur. My primary research intersests lie in Robot learning and Embodied Intelligence. 

For over a year and a half, I've been an active member of the Intelligent Systems and Controls Lab at IIT Kanpur, working under the guidance [Prof. Tushar Sandhan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~sandhan/) and [Prof. Laxmidhar Behera](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~lbehera/). 

During the past summer, I had the privilege of undertaking a fully-funded research expedition to Canada as part of the MITACS Globalink Research Internship. Guided by [Prof. Hashim Mohamed](https://carleton.ca/mae/profile/hashim-mohamed/), I focused my efforts on Out-Of-Distribution Detection.

**GAN-based Out-Of-Distribution Detection**

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

**Bin Picking Novel Objects in Cluttered Environments**

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
