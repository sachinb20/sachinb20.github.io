Hi there! I am Sachin, a fourth year Undergraduate double majoring in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur. My primary research intersests lie in Robotics and Robot Learning. 

For over a year and a half, I've been an active member of the Intelligent Systems and Controls Lab at IIT Kanpur, working on robot grasping and manipulation under the guidance of [Prof. Tushar Sandhan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~sandhan/) and [Prof. Laxmidhar Behera](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~lbehera/). 

During the past summer, I had the privilege of undertaking a fully-funded research expedition to Canada as part of the [MITACS Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) where I worked with [Prof. Hashim Mohamed](https://carleton.ca/mae/profile/hashim-mohamed/) on Out-Of-Distribution Detection.

Projects
------

**GAN-based Out-Of-Distribution Detection**

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/OOD.png){: .align-left width="300px"}

Developed a methodology to detect Out‑Of‑Distribution (OOD) samples, proposing a novel approach that combines a learned confidence score with a GAN‑generated outlier samples to accurately identify OOD samples.<br>

**Bin Picking Novel Objects in Cluttered Environments**

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/Bin-Picking.png){: .align-left width="200px"}

<br>In this project we develop an integrated bin‑picking framework that can grasp unknown transparent and semi‑transparent objects in a cluttered environment effectively . This is achieved by combining a category-agnostic instance‑segmentation method and an analytical grasp evaluation method.<br><br><br><br><br>

**Learning 6DoF Grasp-poses in Occluded Scenes**

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/6dPose_Diagrams.png){: .align-left width="400px"}

A deep learning based framework for learning 6DoF apple fruit grasp‑poses for the application of robotic fruit harvesting. Designed the framework using an instance segmentation network followed by a PointNet based grasp‑pose estimation network.<br>

**Autonomous Navigation System for a Brainwave‑controlled Wheelchair**

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/BCI_integration.png){: .align-left width="300px"}

Worked on a project focusing on designing an autonomous wheelchair system that responds to commands from a brain-computer interface, tailored specifically for individuals with physical disabilities enhancing mobility and independence for those with limited physical capabilities.<br>

**Development of AI Combat Robots** 

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/robomaster.png){: .align-left width="250px"}

Developed autonomous robots for 2v2 detection and shooting combat in a predefined battlefield, participating in the RoboMaster University AI Challenge. Bagged the overall [Third Position](files/Robomaster_Certificate.pdf) in IEEE ICRA DJI RoboMaster AI challenge among the 40 international team, represented India as the only Indian team in the competition. <br>

**RoboSweep: Autonomous Floor Cleaning Swarm Robots** 

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/simul.png){: .align-left width="250px"}

Deployed an Area coverage algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization heuristic for Optimal Spatial Coverage of an unknown region to maximize search area for clean in minimum time using a set of intelligent agents.<br>
Designed a robot with an advanced floor cleaning mechanism for wet and dry waste and set up the simulation environment in Gazebo.<br>
Cleared the first round of the AIITRA Challenge and received a [Special Mention](https://www.facebook.com/officialaiitra/posts/152936723735786) in the final round for the AIITRA Challenge (Team Wall‑E).<br>
