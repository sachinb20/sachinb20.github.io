Hi there! I am Sachin, a fourth year Undergraduate double majoring in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur. My primary research intersests lie in Robotics and Robot Learning. 

For over a year and a half, I've been an active member of the Intelligent Systems and Controls Lab at IIT Kanpur, working on robot grasping and manipulation under the guidance of [Prof. Tushar Sandhan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~sandhan/) and [Prof. Laxmidhar Behera](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~lbehera/). 

During the past summer, I had the privilege of undertaking a fully-funded research expedition to Canada as part of the [MITACS Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) where I worked with [Prof. Hashim Mohamed](https://carleton.ca/mae/profile/hashim-mohamed/) on Out-Of-Distribution Detection.

Projects
------

**GAN-based Out-Of-Distribution Detection**

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/OOD.png){: .align-left width="300px"}

Developed a methodology to detect Out‑Of‑Distribution (OOD) samples, proposing a novel approach that combines a learned confidence score with a GAN‑generated outlier samples to accurately identify OOD samples.


**Learning 6DoF Grasp-poses in Occluded Scenes**

A deep learning based framework for learning 6DoF apple fruit grasp‑poses for the application of robotic fruit har‑
vesting. Designed the framework using an instance segmentation network followed by a PointNet based grasp‑pose estimation network.<br>

**Autonomous Navigation System for a Brainwave‑controlled Wheelchair**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template.<br><br><br>

**Bin Picking Novel Objects in Cluttered Environments**

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/Bin-Picking.png){: .align-left width="200px"}

An integrated bin‑picking framework that can grasp unknown transparent and semi‑transparent objects in a cluttered environment effectively combining a category-agnostic instance‑segmentation method and an analytical grasp evaluation method.<br><br><br><br><br>

**Development of AI Combat Robots** 

![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](images/robomaster.png){: .align-left width="250px"}

Developed autonomous robots for 2v2 detection and shooting combat in a predefined battlefield, participating in the RoboMaster University AI Challenge. Bagged the overall [Third Position](files/Robomaster_Certificate.pdf) in IEEE ICRA DJI RoboMaster AI challenge among the 40 international team, represented India as the only Indian team in the competition. <br>
