Hi there! I am Sachin, a fourth year Undergraduate double majoring in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur. My primary research intersests lie in Robot learning and Embodied Intelligence. 

For over a year and a half, I've been an active member of the Intelligent Systems and Controls Lab at IIT Kanpur, working under the guidance [Prof. Tushar Sandhan](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~sandhan/) and [Prof. Laxmidhar Behera](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~lbehera/). 

During the past summer, I had the privilege of undertaking a fully-funded research expedition to Canada as part of the MITACS Globalink Research Internship. Guided by [Prof. Hashim Mohamed](https://carleton.ca/mae/profile/hashim-mohamed/), I focused my efforts on Out-Of-Distribution Detection.
